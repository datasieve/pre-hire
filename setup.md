##Setup
###Your machine

Every full-time employee is offered a budget of $3,000 for setup & equipment. We strongly prefer Apple products.

The following is an ideal and recommended setup for working with us:

* MacBook [Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/) or [Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)
* [Apple Thunderbolt Display](http://www.apple.com/displays/)
* [Apple Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/keyboard/) & [Magic Mouse](http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/)

*Note: Your budget should include any necessary cables or accessories.*

Since we occasionally host [hackathons](/hackathons), one of our only requirements is that you have a laptop.

You are also allowed to purchase equipment from other places.

When you have your setup details finalized, please send all related links to [Auston](mailto:auston@1saleaday.com).
