Version Control
------
We use git. It's pretty great. If you're not familiar, mess with [this great learning application from CodeSchool & GitHub](http://try.github.com). 

We think it's important that you know a lot of git before you get started, including:

* Forks
* Branches
* Merging
* Rebases
* Resolving conflicts
* Blames
* Configuration (adding remote repos & .gitignore)


Ruby
------

Here is a link to the style that we have adopted as a pattern:
[Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)

Testing is crazy important, we make use of:

* Unit tests (heavily)
* Functional tests (hardly, we're putting an emphasis on this moving forward)
* Integration tests (too much, we're hoping to slim these down since they're so slow!)

* Haml [read more](http://haml.info/)

JavaScript

* Jquery [read more](http://jquery.com/)
* Highcharts [read more](http://www.highcharts.com/)
* Colorbox [read more](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox)

However we are making a concious effort to move towards a more MV* oriented approach to our JavaScript. You should keep this in mind ;)

We don't have any tests besides integration for JavaScript but we'll more than likely be using things like Jasmine for JavaScript testing.

CSS

* Jammit
* CSS2
* CSS3
* Cross Browser Compatibility

Continuous Integration
--

We are moving toward a continuous integration workflow, so its very important to have strong test, and lots of test coverage. [read more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
